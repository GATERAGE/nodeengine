# Component Configuration Library

The `component_config.py` in the libs directory provides a mechanism to manage the component configurations within the Node Engine. It wraps utilities around the FlowDefinition's components to streamline access to component-specific configurations, supporting dynamic templating and default configurations.

## ComponentConfig Class

- **Initialization**: Requires a FlowDefinition object, a component's key, and an optional dictionary for default values.

- **Configuration Management**: The class parses the FlowDefinition's components to find and load the configuration associated with the given key. It evaluates templates within the configuration using the flow's context for dynamic value assignment.

- **Methods**: Include `get` to retrieve configuration values, `has_key` to check for a specific key, and internal error handling to ensure the integrity of the component configuration retrieval process.

This library plays a crucial role in ensuring that flow components can be configured dynamically with context-dependent values, adding to the flexibility and adaptability of flow execution within the Node Engine.
