# Context Management Library

The `context.py` file in the libs directory defines a class to facilitate context management within the Node Engine. The context of a flow is a critical component that holds data to be passed between individual components during execution.

## Context Class

- **Initialization**: Takes a FlowDefinition object and optionally a logger for error reporting.

- **Data Retrieval**: The `get` method retrieves context data using a specified key, with an option to set a default value if the key is not present.

- **Data Deletion**: The `delete` method removes a key-value pair from the context.

- **Data Setting**: The `set` method allows setting or updating context data for a given key.

- **Key Validation**: The `validate_presence_of` method checks for the existence of a key within the context.

- **Serialization**: The `json` method enables the serialization of the context data to a JSON string.

This Context class is vital for managing state across various steps in a flow and ensures that components have access to and can manipulate a shared context.
